# STED-analysis_Tpr_Nup153

This is a series of scripts written in Matlab and Jupyter Notebooks to analyze Tpr and Nup153 STED images.
The goal of this package is to extract information about heterogeneity in NPC baskets from STED data.
1- Nup153 and Tpr images are segmented using an automatic threshold and watershed segmentation procedure (Matlab)

2- region properties are extracted

3- and compiled

4- histograms of particles circularity anc Tpr-Nup153 distances are calculated.

5- histograms are fitted with Gaussians (Python)
